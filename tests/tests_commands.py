# pytest - run tests
# for pytest auto-discovery, ensure to name files and function like test_[name]
# pytest -v to increase verbosity - give little more info about the test (show the exact test that passed)
# pytest -v -s to ensure pytest run any print statement included in the function (add -s flag)
# to run specific test, pass the path to the test as the next argument tests/[name]
# pytest -v -s -x to stop a test immediately it fails - first failure
